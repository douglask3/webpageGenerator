### Current Research Interests

Need to change
Doug is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working with the Climate And Forest Ecosystem Modelling and Biosphere and Climate Dynamic groups at Macquarie University. His research focuses on modelling the interactions between wildfire, climate and vegetation. In addition, he is also working on plant resource allocation strategies. He is particularly interested in ways vegetation resist and recover after fire, and the wider implications this has on the carbon cycle and hydrology.

### Skills {#skills}



Modelling
  : I have been lead developer on LPX - a high-complaexity coupled Dynamic Vegetation-Fire Model - since 2009. LPX has both Fortran and C++ components for fast (relive to it's complexity) computational times. I have recently also added a shell and R interface to fasilitate parrallization and to allow results to be easily plotted and analysed.

      * See [douglask3.github.io/LPX.html](http://douglask3.gitgub.io/LPX.html) for more information.

Statistical Programming
  : Most of my research involves statistical anaylsis of large datasets and model outputs. Collaboration on many of my projects means I am fluent in most widely used statistical programming languages. Most of my work is in either R, python and matlab, but I have also performed graphical and statitical analysis using Fotran and C amongst others.

      * See [douglas.github.io/my_best_plots.html](http://douglas.github.io/my_best_plots.html) for examples of R and matlab plots from my PhD.
      * See [bitbucket.org/douglask3/lpxbenchmarking](https://bitbucket.org/douglask3/lpxbenchmarking) for an example of statistical benchmarking of extensive model outputs again global raster and site-based datasets.

Web Design
  : In my spare time, I have developed dynamic websites using open source content management system. My personal site is on a static host, but is maintained using a python based dynamic-site emulator. Developing and maintaining these sites have allowed me to become familiar with many contengt managment systems (i.e. wordpress, concrete5 etc) and fluent in HTML/CSS, PHP and Markdown. I have linked Markdown with R and python when sharing and presenting results from model development and anlaysis.
        * See [eppingdac.com.au](http://www.eppingdac.com.au/), an example of a website I have developed using Concrete5 Content Managment System
        * See [douglask3.github.io](http://douglask3.gothub.io), and exmaple of a website produced using a simple dynamic-site emulator.

Publishing
  : As well has publishing papers, I have also written manuals, reports and newletters using a variety of languages and software products, including (aside from standard office/open office):
    * Latex - this includes my thesis (available <<>>)
    * Scribus - for example, my running clubs newsletter ([eppingdac.com.au/news-and-views/newsletter](http://www.eppingdac.com.au/news-and-views/newsletter/)]
    * Photoshop/Illistrator and GIMP (the open source equivalent). See [flickr.com/doug_from_the_uk](http://flickr.com/doug_from_the_uk) for examples of graphical art and photo 'touch ups', manipulation.

### Software Tool
Collaborations on various projects has lead me to develop software packages to share across projects teams.
Some these perform statistical model-comparisons; others run vegetation models themselves, and some help keep track for workflows and provenance when using a version control system model.
Below are some of the most used software packages. More detail can be doun at [douglask3.github.io/tools](http://douglask3.github.io/tools), while an exhustive list can be found on my bitbucket and github repository pages detailed in the contact section.
