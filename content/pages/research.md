My research focuses on improving our understanding of the interactions between fire, vegetation and climate, and exploring how these interactions feed through to ... such as the carbon cycle and hydrology. I am particularly interested in ways to utilise experimental and satellite data to develop more evidence based models.

In 2014, I completed my PhD - entitled ``Modelling Australian Fire Regimes`` at Macquarie University, under the supervision of Sandy Harrison, Colin Prentice and Belinda Medlyn. The involved the developing and implementing a process-based fire model in a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model .... . Benchmarking, ndnnd

I implementing a data assimilation framework to combine satellite derived observations, with a simple carbon balance ecosystem model (DALEC) to estimate (with uncertainty) global carbon stocks and fluxes.

After completing my PhD I moved to the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) to take up a position with the grand job title: "Earth Observation and Land Surface Modeller". Here, I worked with Chris Taylor, applying timeseries analysis to satellite data to characterise the timescales over which the land surface responds to rainfall events in West Africa.

In 2010, I moved to the bottom of the globe (from my perspective!), where I have been employed as a postdoc in Belinda Medlyn's Climate and Forest Ecosystem Modelling (CAFE M) lab. At Macquarie University, my focus has been on synthesising a number of Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments, both from the US and here in Australia, to identify key areas of model weakness. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a new generation of terrestrial biosphere models, which more accurately reflect experimental understanding of the response of vegetation to elevated CO2.

More recently, in collaboration with Andy Pitman's group at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, I have led innovative research that have improved the simulations of water fluxes by the Australian Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange land surface model.

At present, I am developing probabilistic model estimates of the risk of drought mortality for tree species across the Australian landscape. The results of this work will assist conservation management of tree species, in preparation for rising temperature and shifting rainfall patterns expected under a changing climate.

Feel free to drop me an email if any of that sounds interesting!
