My research focuses on improving our understanding of the interactions between fire, vegetation and climate, and exploring how these interactions feed impact terrestrial ecosystem properties such as carbon and hydrological cycles. I'm also involved in continued development of a vegetation model benchmarking system; and collaborate on research exploring resource allocation and pheneology strategies, and  strategies for avoiding draught mortality. Much of this involves utilising experimental and satellite data to drive more observation-driven vegetation model development.

I completed my PhD - ``Modelling Australian Fire Regimes``  - in 2014 at Macquarie University, Australia, under the supervision of Sandy Harrison, Colin Prentice and Belinda Medlyn. My thesis focussed on the development and application the LPX coupled Dynamic Global Vegetation – Fire model (DGVM-fire) in order to simulate changes in fire regime under future climate scenarios, and the impacts this may have on vegetation processes and carbon stocks.

Outside of my PhD, I have also had experience in modelling past climates, including comparisons of modelled outputs to vegetation and climate proxies (pollen, charcoel and isotope records). Besides working on fire, I am also involved in the development of a simple new moisture-driven  phenology model based on … simple dampled harmanic oscillator (such as a spring or pendulum).

I moved to Reading back in the UK in early 2015 to cotinue work on fire modelling, expanding my work on climate drivers of specific fire regime changes and disturbance trait analyis, and to … FIREMIP
