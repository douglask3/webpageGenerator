My research focuses on improving our understanding of the interactions between fire, vegetation and climate, and exploring how these interactions feed impact terrestrial ecosystem properties such as carbon and hydrological cycles. I'm also involved in continued development of a vegetation model benchmarking system; and collaborate on research exploring resource allocation and pheneology strategies, and  strategies for avoiding draught mortality. Much of this involves utilising experimental and satellite data to drive more observation-driven vegetation model development.
